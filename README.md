# JavaScript Text Editor

This is a custom built text editor made with JavaScript that outputs JSON.

It uses a `contenteditable` HTML element as the wrapper.

Features include making headers, italicizing, bolding, and underlining text, centering and indenting text, inserting links and images, and creating blockquotes.
